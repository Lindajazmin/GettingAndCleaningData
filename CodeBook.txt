CODEBOOK

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation following the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s definition.


INTRODUCTION: Download and Read Data, checking if archieve and folder exists.
Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset and is named filename.


STEP 1: Assign each data to variables
 
a. features<-features.txt (561 rows, 2 columns)
   The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ.

b. activities<-activity_labels.txt (6 rows, 2 columns)
   List of activities performed when the corresponding measurements were taken and its codes (labels)

c. subject_test<-test/subject_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
   Contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed

d. x_test <- test/X_test.txt (2947 rows, 561 columns)
   Contains recorded features test data

e. y_test <- test/y_test.txt (2947 rows, 1 column)
   Contains test data of activities’code labels

f. subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
   Contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed

g. x_train <- test/X_train.txt (7352 rows, 561 columns)
   Contains recorded features train data

i. y_train <- test/y_train.txt (7352 rows, 1 column)
   Contains train data of activities’code labels


STEP 2: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

a. X is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
b. Y is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
c. subject is created by merging subject_train and subject_test using rbind() function
d. merged_data is created by merging subject, Y and X using cbind() function


STEP 3: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

tidyData (10299 rows, 88 columns) is created by subsetting merged_data, selecting the columns: subject, code and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement.


STEP 4: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Entire numbers in code column of the tidyData replaced with corresponding activity taken from second column of the activities variable


STEP 5: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names

a. code column in tidyData renamed into "activityName"
b. All Acc in column’s name replaced by "Accelerometer"
c. All Gyro in column’s name replaced by "Gyroscope"
d. All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by "Body"
e. All Mag in column’s name replaced by "Magnitude"
f. All start with character f in column’s name replaced by "Frequency"
g. All start with character t in column’s name replaced by "Time"


STEP 6: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalTidyData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing tidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.
Export FinalTidyData into TidyData.txt file.

Finally contains code to verify TidyData table.
